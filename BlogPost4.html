      <h2>Aman Sehrawat: India’s Wrestling Sensation</h2>
      <p>
        Sehrawat’s journey to the Olympic stage has been nothing short of remarkable. With his lightning-fast moves and
        unwavering determination, he has quickly become one of India’s most promising wrestlers. His performance in the
        earlier rounds of the Paris Olympics has showcased his potential to bring home a medal for his country. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Road to the Bronze-Medal Match</b> <br>
        • Defeated opponents from Kazakhstan and Iran in the initial rounds <br>
        • Narrowly missed out on the gold medal match after a tough semi-final bout <br>
        • Bounced back strong in the repechage round to secure a spot in the bronze-medal match <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      <h2>The Opponent: Darian Toi Cruz </h2><br>
      Standing between Sehrawat and the bronze medal is Darian Toi Cruz, a formidable wrestler from Cuba. Cruz has shown
      impressive form throughout the tournament, making this match-up one to watch.

      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Key Factors to Watch:</b> <br>
        • Sehrawat’s agility and quick thinking on the mat
        • Cruz’s strength and experience in international competitions
        • The mental game: Who can handle the pressure of an Olympic medal match?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>What’s at Stake for India</b> <br>
        A medal in wrestling would be a significant boost for India’s Olympic campaign. The country has a rich history
        in this sport, with notable performances in previous Games. Sehrawat’s potential podium finish would not only
        add to this legacy but also inspire the next generation of Indian wrestlers.
